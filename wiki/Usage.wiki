#summary How to use yanglab-ctrax and the analysis scripts.

== Tracking and analyzing the sample video ==

This project has a 10-minute sample video (from our "UV on/off" experiments) that can be used to go through the tracking and analysis process.  The sample is 16.1MB and in M-JPEG format.  (It is the first 10 minutes of an 8h video with 853MB.) 

  * Download the video.
  * Track.
  * Start MATLAB
    * One-time: go into the Ctrax-allmatlab-X.Y.Z/behavioralmicroarray directory and execute
{{{
setuppath
cd ../yanglab/
}}}
    * For each video:
{{{
[trx,matname,succeeded] = load_tracks
analyze_tracks                          % select "Cancel" when asked to choose an egg file
}}}
