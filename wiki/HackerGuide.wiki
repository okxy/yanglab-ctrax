#summary Notes and comments on our code.

== Ctrax extensions (yanglab-ctrax) ==

  * To see (almost) all of the changes we did to Ctrax, check out r6.
  * The on/off detector learns the on/off state for each frame during tracking, and adds the info to the Ctrax MAT-file in field `YL_on_changes`.  The format is best explained in an example:
{{{
>> trx(1).YL_on_changes(1:5, :)

ans =

           1           1
        2237           0
        4488           1
        6740           0
        8992           1
}}}
    * There is a row for each _change_ in on/off state.
      * The first column has the number of the _first_ frame in the new state.
      * The second column has the new state ("on"=1).
    * So in this example, the state was "on" from frame 1 to 2236, then "off" from frame 2237 to 4487, etc.

== Analysis scripts ==

  * The code for the analysis scripts should be "refactored."
